       "'Trieste, 26 June 1914 Dear Mr. Joyce, Many thanks for your kind present. You may imagine how carefully I shall read the work of my teacher and friend. Surely I shall speak about the new book (Dubliners) with everybody I can suppose capable of being interested with an English work of Irish contents. When will you write an Italian work about our town? Why not? Many thanks also from   my   wife. I hope you will soon offer me the opportunity to talk with you about the many pages of yours I had now the opportunity to read. Do you know that I have now discovered that Dedalus is not only an eyeing and looking animal but that he has also a strongly developed sense for smells? I found this quality was hidden for me behind your awful handwriting which is not much better than mine. Believe me,   dear Mr. Joyce, Yours   truly Ettore Schmitz '"
